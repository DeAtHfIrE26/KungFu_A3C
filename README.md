## üí° Implementation Highlights

1. **Neural Network Architecture**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) to process the game state, followed by fully connected layers for action value and state value prediction.
   ```python
   class Network(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self, action_size):
           super(Network, self).__init__()
           self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=4, out_channels=32, kernel_size=3, stride=2)
           self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 32, kernel_size=3, stride=2)
           self.conv3 = nn.Conv2d(32, 32, kernel_size=3, stride=2)
           self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
           self.fc1 = nn.Linear(512, 128)
           self.fc2a = nn.Linear(128, action_size)
           self.fc2s = nn.Linear(128, 1)

    Multi-Threaded Training: Leveraging A3C with multiprocessing to run multiple agents simultaneously.

    python

def train_worker(worker_id):
    env = gym.make('KungFu-Atari-v0')
    model = Network(action_size=env.action_space.n)
    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
    # Training loop for the worker

Preprocessing: Using an observation wrapper to preprocess the Atari frames into grayscale and resize for optimal neural network performance.

python

    class PreprocessAtari(ObservationWrapper):
        def __init__(self, env, height=42, width=42):
            super().__init__(env)
            self.height, self.width = height, width

üìà Performance

    Training Threads: 8 parallel agents
    Max Episode Length: 500 steps
    Total Training Time: 10 hours (on GPU)
    Reward Optimization: Utilizing advantage-based updates to optimize learning speed and stability.

‚ú® Future Enhancements

    Expand to More Atari Games: Applying A3C to other environments such as Pong or Breakout.
    Real-time Analytics: Integrating TensorBoard for real-time performance tracking.
    3D Action Replay: Add a 3D game replay system powered by Unity for post-training visualization.
